# custom-oe-macros
Macros are great way to improve your productivity, especially for someone new to OpenEdge which has a different syntax from the usual programming languages. Here are some custom ones.

Adding these macros should be simple, just go to your:
-> OpenEdge project 
-> Window
-> Preferences
-> Progress OpenEdge - Colapse
-> Editor - Colapse
-> Templates
-> Select Import

Here you have two options, import single macros/templates or import all of them. 

allinone.xml - the file containing all the macros/templates

the rest of the individual.xml files are individual macros/templates

CheatSheet.pdf - for helping you out getting used to these.
